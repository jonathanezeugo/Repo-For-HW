# Repo-For-HW

# This is for the HOMEWORK-1 - Excel Homework. This homework is based on a crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, used to organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover hidden trends that help determine basis for successful projects.

# Excel was used for the organizing and analysis of the data, tables and charts were generated for the projects data that capture data trends that help determine projects that are successful, when in an annual calendar they were more successful and how much the successful projects data varied from the data mean. Findings are shown in the Starterbook Excel file and responses to key questions asked in the Homework are presented in the attached Microsoft Word document titled - StarterBook Responses.
